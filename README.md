## How to get Started?
1. Make your you have installed node in your system.
2. Clone the repository or dowload the zip file
3. Open the unzipped file in VS code or any other code editor

## COMMANDS
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun
```
npm run server

## Admin page
After landing on admin sign in 
Enter the password: Admin-Branch 
First, run the development server:


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
